PURPOSE:
This project concerns with the research on developing a recommender system for User, Items and Rating.


PERCENT COMPLETE: 100%
Completed Successfully.

BUGS:None.

-FILES:
Recommender.py  --a python file to predict the rating.
README.txt 		--Reademe file containing the information to run the program.
Output.txt 		--Output result after runing the Recommender.py file containg ratings for all user x items.
train_all_txt.txt-Input file


-TO COMPILE:


-Prepare:
Put the provided Recommender.py file and the input file named "train_all_txt.txt" in the same folder.
I have coded and runed in Pycharm python ide
libraries used are as follows
1. numpy
2. scipy.stats
3. time

-TO RUN:
commmand:
python Recommender.py


-SAMPLE OUTPUT:
The output file is generated named as "Output.txt"
Total time of execution is displayed on the console
First 5 lines of the output file is shown as follows:

1 1 5
1 2 3
1 3 4
1 4 3
1 5 3

-ALGORITHM USED: 
Collaborative Filtering ALgorithm


-TIME TO RUN:
The program takes around 790 sec to genrate the predicted results.


-BIBLIOGRAPHY:
This serves as evidence that we are in no way intending Academic Dishonesty.
